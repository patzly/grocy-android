## 3.3.0

Grocy server version 4.0.0 has some bigger changes with quantity units and unit conversions.
Please read the server changelog carefully for longer explanations of the changes before or after
your server update. We recommend installing the update as our app was mainly tested with it and
recipe ingredient fulfillment information in our app are finally all correct and complete with it.
Older supported versions still work but are not tested with every new change.

We kindly ask you to give our app a good review on Google Play if you like it or a star for our
GitHub repository. This helps us to spread the word about the app and will motivate us to
implement new features.
