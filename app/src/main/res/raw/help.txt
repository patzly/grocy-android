## FAQ

#### Which permissions are requested and why?

- <b>Internet</>: to access your grocy server
- <b>Access network state</>: to monitor internet connectivity changes
- <b>Camera</>: to scan barcodes
- <b>Vibration</>: to perform haptic effects e. g. after scanning a barcode

#### All pages are just blank?

That's a bug on a few devices out there, mostly with Android 8.1 and 9. For a workaround please
activate the following option:

OPTION_USE_SLIDING

#### How do I know what something does?

Starting with Android 8 you can long-press almost every clickable element without a label to see
what it will do.

#### My API key is invalid. What can I do?

Tap <b>Create key</b> to open the key management page of your grocy instance.
Create a new key and copy it to your clipboard, then paste it in the key field of Grocy Android
and try again.

If you use Hass.io with the Grocy Add-on, continue to the next section.

#### How can I use this app with the grocy Home Assistant add-on?

After tapping <b>Own server</b> on the login page, you will be prompted to scan the QR code from
an API key of your grocy server. Once you do that, the app will detect that you are using Home
Assistant and prompt you to scan the QR code of a long-lived access token from Home Assistant. You
can get this in your Home Assistant user profile in the bottom section. Once you scan the QR code,
you will be directed to a form where you will need to fill in any missing data. If you have followed
the steps up to this point, all that should be left is the server URL of Home Assistant (i.e. the
URL where you can reach your Home Assistant instance). Be aware that you may add the port if your
server uses another port than 443 or 80 (e.g. the local port of Home Assistant server is 8123).

You can also enter the URL of your Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa), if you use this service. The
URL must then be in the form `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.ui.nabu.casa/`. Since typing
can cause typos, we recommend copying the URL from somewhere else via Android's clipboard and
pasting it into the field.

#### Why are my barcodes unreadable if I use the selfie camera?

Most devices have a front camera with a fixed focus for the normal distance between your face and
the device. With this distance, the picture resolution is sometimes too low for the scanning
algorithm.

#### What is ML Kit barcode scanner?

ML Kit is an alternative AI-based barcode scanner which is implemented in the Google Play and
GitHub version of our app since v2.0.0, F-Droid doesn't allow closed-source app components and
thus we can't offer the same version there. ML Kit is from Google and doesn't make recognition
mistakes compared to ZXing (the primary scanner option in our app). Additionaly, you don't have
to align the barcode horizontally in your camera because it recognizes barcodes with any
orientation. Go to <b>App settings > Scanner > Choose barcode scanner</b> to use ML Kit. You can
either purchase the required unlock app in Google Play Store (which would make us happy) or you
can download the unlock APK on GitHub.

#### How can I connect to my instance through Tor Hidden Service or Proxy?

Go to <b>App settings > Network</b> and enable Tor support or HTTP-Proxy. Orbot is required for
Tor support.

#### How can I use my USB or Bluetooth™ barcode scanner device?

Go to <b>App settings > Scanner</b> and enable support for external scanners. Then you can connect
a scanner for example using USB or Bluetooth™ and use it on the purchase/consume/transfer/inventory
pages (the product field must be focused). Your scanner should have TAB or Enter as suffix,
otherwise the workflow won't start after a scan.

easy navigation to the consume page or other pages in the app using physical interaction.
